This first series is related to M. Kuhn and K. Johnson book "Applied Predictive Modeling". The book pdf is available [here](https://vuquangnguyen2016.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/applied-predictive-modeling-max-kuhn-kjell-johnson_1518.pdf), but if, like me, you prefer to have a paper copy of the book, you can purchase it [here](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Predictive-Modeling-Max-Kuhn/dp/1461468485/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1540208647&sr=8-1&keywords=applied+predictive+modeling). **This post is dedicated to section 6 on linear regression.**
