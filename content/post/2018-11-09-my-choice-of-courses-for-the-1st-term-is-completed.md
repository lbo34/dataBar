The start of my Master is getting close. I have now completed the choice of courses to take in the 1st term. I will follow 4 courses, 3 statistics-heavy courses that are in compulsory track ("statistical analysis and inference", "applied multidimensional analysis" and "data mining techniques"). The 4th one is non-mandatory and is called "software in statistics".

**"statistical analysis and inference"** is the entry level course in statistics in the master. It covers the topics of:
* linear models and generalized linear models;
* likelihood and bayesian methods;
* analysis of correlated data;
* non-parametric methods;
* robust methods;
* density estiimation and non parametric regression.
This course can be followed *either with R or with SAS*. As I already have a good base in R programming, I am planning to do it with SAS (maybe both!)

**"applied multidimensional analysis"** covers the following topics:
* exploratory factorial analysis;
* variable and model selection;
* logistic regression;
* cluster analysis;
* survival analysis;
* missing data;
The labs of this course are done with SAS software.

**"data mining techniques"** covers the following topics:
* data preparation;
* association rules;
* classification and regression trees;
* bagging, boosting and random forests;
* neural networks;
* incremental modeling;
The labs of this course are also done with SAS.

Finally, **"software in statistics"** covers:
* Programming with R (including graphics, RMarkdown, data wrangling...)
* Porgramming with SAS
* SQL
* Tableau
