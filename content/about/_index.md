Hello and welcome on this blog.

I am Laurent Barcelo. I am French and Canadian, born in the south of France on the mediterranean shore. I am married with Catherine et father of 2, RaphaÃ«l and Arthur who are 16 years old. I am 45 and we live in Montreal, QC, Canada.

I've been trainined as an Engineer. I also hold a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering. I spent more than 20 years in Innovation and R&D related positions for a large group of construction materials. Recently, I decided to go back to school and switch carreer: I am about to start a data science M.Sc. at HEC Montreal.

This blog is one of two blogs. If focuses on my experience as a data scientist in training. The other blog [here](https://www.laurentbarcelo.com) (in french) focuses more on the human experience.
